Visual Studio

Download and install Visual C++ Express 2010 from http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP

Boost library

1) Visual Studio project uses environment variable BOOST_DIR which points to root of Boost library.
2) Boost Log library should be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost-log/
and placed as boost library.
3) Following libraries must be built: filesystem, date_time, thread, regex, log.

For Boost Asio add directive "#define BOOST_ASIO_HAS_MOVE" to "boost\config\user.hpp" file.

Note: Boost Log 1.0(not 1.1) uses Boost Filesystem v2(which was default until Boost 1.46.0), so to compile do following:
    - add macro "BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION 2" to "boost\config\user.hpp" file.
    - pass --disable-filesystem3 arg to bjam for all commands.
        The one way to define that macro is add it to "boost\config\user.hpp" file.
        More info at http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/libs/filesystem/v2/doc/index.htm.
        Strange but bjam arg "define='BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION=2'" does not work.

Commands sequence without explanation(see details below):
    3.1) for Release config:
         bjam --with-date_time --with-thread --with-regex --with-filesystem  link=static runtime-link=static
         bjam --with-log define=BOOST_LOG_NO_COMPILER_TLS link=static runtime-link=static 
    3.2) for Debug config:
         bjam --with-date_time --with-thread --with-regex --with-filesystem 
         bjam --with-log define=BOOST_LOG_NO_COMPILER_TLS
4) ICU library
    4.1) Download ICU windows src from here: http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/49.1.1/icu4c-49_1_1-src.zip
    4.2) Open src\source\allinone\allinone.sln
    4.3) Tune common project both in Debug and Release configurations:
            4.3.1) Define macro U_STATIC_IMPLEMENTATION.
            4.3.2) Set Target name(in Configuration properties->General) to:
                    "icu_$(ProjectName)d" in Debug mode
                    "icu_$(ProjectName)" in Release mode
            4.3.3) Set Configuration type(in Configuration properties->General) to Static library.
            4.3.4) In Relese config only: set Configuration properties->C++->Code Generation->Runtime library to Multi-threaded.
         
Details:
    To build as "Multi-threaded DLL" (currently used by Debug configuration) use command:
            bjam --with-filesystem --with-date_time --with-thread --with-regex
        Boost Log must be built with BOOST_LOG_NO_COMPILER_TLS define, since crash occurs inside void boost::log::source::aux::set_severity_level(int level) without it on Windows XP(on Windows Vista/7 works fine).
        See details at http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/2s9wt68x.aspx, note about __declspec(thread) in DLL on Windows before Vista.
            bjam --with-log define=BOOST_LOG_NO_COMPILER_TLS
    To build with "Multi-threaded" runtime (currently used by Release configuration) add options to bjam:
        link=static runtime-link=static
    To rebuild library use "bjam --with-XXX --clean" command, then build as usual.
    To choose VS version use "--toolset=XXX", when XXX can be following: msvc-9.0, msvc-10.0.

Python

Download and install Python 2.7 and module lxml for this version.
Required to run tools\html_optimizer.py script which makes release version of client scripts.

SubWCRev

This tool is used to update build version of project in version.txt file.
It is included in TortoiseSVN client, but can be downloaded separately from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisesvn/files/Tools
If you don't care about build version just comment out UPDATE_PROJECT_BUILD_VERSION code in build_installer.bat script.

Inno Setup

Download and install Inno Setup QuickStart Pack from here: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php#qsp
This pack includes preprocessor(which is not included in Inno Setup distrib) used by aimp_control_plugin.iss script.

Perl

Download and install Perl from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl
Used to create PDB file which usefull for debugging release version of plugin DLL.

Debugging Tools for Windows

Download and install from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463009
Contains symbol server which syncronizes plugin DLL with it's PDB file. Usefull for debugging.

Win32 build of Subversion

Download and install from http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32svn
Used for creating PDB file with links to source files in SVN repository. Usefull for debugging.

FreeImage
Download FreeImage DLL(for example, FreeImage 3.15.0 [WIN32]) from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html and unzip to some folder.
If you do not want use precompiled package you can download source distribution.
Requiired only for enabling Rpc function which extracts album cover.

After installing software mentioned above set actual paths in setup_environment.bat and setup_vs_project_variables.bat scripts.


To create Release version run build_plugin.bat script.
    It will create temp_build\Release folder with plugin DLL, client scripts.
To create installer build installer use build_installer.bat script.
    It will create installer in temp_build\Release\distrib.
    
To debug plugin in Visual Studio launch vs_launch.bat script.
    Important note: do not launch msvc/aimp_control_plugin.vcxproj project directly since project relies on environment variables which are set by vs_launch.bat script.
    To easy switch between AIMP2 and AIMP3:
        1) Make symbolic links with name AIMP.exe for AIMP2.exe and AIMP3.exe and put them near correspond executable files.
        2) In project properties, Configuration Properties->Debugging
                set Command field to "$(AIMP_PLUGINS_DIR)\..\AIMP2.exe"
                set Environment field to "PATH=$(FREEIMAGELIB_DIR)\Dist;$(FREEIMAGELIB_DIR)\Wrapper\FreeImagePlus\Dist"
           We must to add path to FreeImagePlus.dll and to FreeImage.dll to have working getAlbumCover Rpc function.
           If that libraries not found album cover cannot be retrieved through Rpc.
        3) Set AIMP_PLUGINS_DIR variable in setup_vs_project_variables.bat script.
