Installing plugin:

1) Put aimp_control_plugin.dll in AIMP player's "Plugins" directory.

2) Create plugin settings.dat file.
    There are two ways to do that:
        2.1) Just launch AIMP and exit, plugin will save default settings file in plugin folder("Control Plugin") in AIMP Plugins directory.
             "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin\settings.dat"
        2.2) Copy settings.dat from 7z package to "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin" directory.

3) In settings.dat set following values:
    httpserver.document_root - set full path to htdocs directory.
    httpserver.ip_to_bind - set address of network interface where plugin server will work.
