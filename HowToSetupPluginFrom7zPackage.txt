How to install plugin:

1) Put aimp_control_plugin.dll in AIMP player's "Plugins" directory.
2) Put 'htdocs' directory to path which is writeable for AIMP. Do not put it in Program Files dir.
    This is required for album cover support. If you do not need it put it in any folder.
3) Create plugin settings.dat file.
    There are two ways to do that:
        2.1) Just launch AIMP and exit, plugin will save default settings file in plugin folder("Control Plugin") in AIMP Plugins directory.
             "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin\settings.dat"
        2.2) Copy settings.dat from 7z package to "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin" directory.

4) In settings.dat set following values:
    httpserver.document_root - set full path to htdocs directory.
    httpserver.ip_to_bind - set address of network interface where plugin server will work.
    
5) Optional, album cover support 
    Copy following files to "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin" directory:
        FreeImage.dll
        FreeImagePlus.dll
